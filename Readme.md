## A simple ray tracer! Showcasing vectors in cpp

Here is a simple project in raytracing in cpp. Implemented with OpenCV and the Vectors in cpp. 

The project entails the construction of reflection, refraction, shadows, and general ray intersections with surfaces. 

We create structs for Material, Light, and Spheres. Which with their corresponding fields and interaction with mathematical functions that produce phenomena (e.g. Snell's Law)
